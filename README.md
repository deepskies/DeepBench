### What is it?
Simulation library for very simple simulations to *benchmark* machine learning algorithms.



### Why do we need it? Why is it useful?
1. There are very universally recognized scientifically meaningful benchmark data sets, or methods with which to generate them.
2. A very simple data set will have objects, patterns, and signals that are intuitively quanitifiable and will be fast to generate.
3. A very simple data set will be a great testing ground for new networks and for newcomers to practice with the technology.


## Requirements
* python = ">=3.8,<3.11,"
* numpy = "^1.24.3"
* matplotlib = "^3.7.1"
* scikit-image = "^0.20.0"
* astropy = "^5.2.2"
* autograd = "^1.5"
* pyyaml = "^6.0"



## Install

### From PyPi
```
pip install deepbench
```

### From Source

```
git clone https://github.com/deepskies/DeepBench.git
pip install poetry
poetry shell
poetry install
poetry run pytest --cov
```

## General Features
1. very fast to generate
2. Mimics in a very basic / toy way what is in astro images
3. Be fully controllable parametrically

### Included Simulations

1. Astronomy Objects - simple astronomical object simulation
- Galaxy, Spiral Galaxy, Star

2. Shapes - simple 2D geometric shapes
- Rectangle, Regular Polygon, Arc, Line, Ellipse

3. Physics Objects - simple physics simulations

## Example

### Standalone
* Produce 3 instance of a pendulum over 10 different times with some level of noise.
```
import numpy as np
from deepbench.collection import Collection

configuration = {
	"object_type": "physics",
	"object_name": "Pendulum",
	"total_runs": 3,
	"parameter_noise": 0.2,
	"image_parameters": {
		"pendulum_arm_length": 2,
		"starting_angle_radians": 0.25,
		"acceleration_due_to_gravity": 9.8,
		"noise_std_percent":{
			"acceleration_due_to_gravity": 0
	},
	"object_parameters":{
		"time": np.linspace(0, 1, 10)
	}
}

phy_objects = Collection(configuration)()

objects = phy_objects.objects
parameters = phy_objects.object_parameters
```

* Produce a noisy shape image with a rectangle and an arc

```
import numpy as np
from deepbench.collection import Collection

configuration = {
	"object_type": "shape",
	"object_name": "ShapeImage",

	"total_runs": 1,
	"image_parameters": {
		"image_shape": (28, 28),
		"object_noise_level": 0.6
	},

	"object_parameters": {
		[
		"rectangle": {
			"object": {
				"width": np.random.default_rng().integers(2, 28),
				"height": np.random.default_rng().integers(2, 28),
				"fill": True
			},
			"instance": {}
		},
		"arc":{
			"object": {
				"radius": np.random.default_rng().integers(2, 28),
				"theta1":np.random.default_rng().integers(0, 20),
				"theta2":np.random.default_rng().integers(21, 180)
			},
			"instance":{}
		}

		]
	}
}

shape_image = Collection(configuration)()

objects = shape_image.objects
parameters = shape_image.object_parameters
```


### Fine-Grained Control
* Make a whole bunch of stars
```
from deepbench.astro_object import StarObject
import numpy as np

star = StarObject(
        image_dimensions = (28,28),
        noise = 0.3,
        radius= 0.8,
        amplitude = 1.0
    )

generated_stars = []
x_position, y_position = np.random.default_rng().uniform(low=1, high=27, size=(2, 50))
for x_pos, y_pos in zip(x_position, y_position):
	generated-stars.append(star.create_object(x_pos, y_pos))
```
